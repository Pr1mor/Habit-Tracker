# Habit Tracker

This is a simple habit tracker, that let's you track your goals and progress. My goal is to learn React from this project, and also get a refresher on HTML and CSS for future projects.

## Features

1. Adding new habits
2. Performing daily checkins (you can check once you completed the habit)
3. Seeing your progress

## To Do

1. Add delete functionality in the list item
2. Add a completed today button, once that is done change the completed 'X' times with Streak:
3. Once you have the basic functionality, redesign the card so that when use clicks on a habit if expands that habit and user can view more information (e.g dates when completed, edit the name, delete, done today) {This is a big feature and redesign}
