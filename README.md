# Habit Tracker

This is a simple habit tracker, that let's you track your goals and progress. My goal is to learn React from this project, and also get a refresher on HTML and CSS for future projects.

## Features

1. Adding new habits
2. Performing daily checkins (you can check once you completed the habit)
3. Seeing your progress

## To Do

1. Making habits as objects, right now habits are simple string literal so you can add it easily but cannot do anything with it
2. Making the habitItems buttons, so that user can click on it and see information regarding that habit
